Meta XR Simulator is a lightweight OpenXR runtime built for developers and enables you to simulate Meta VR devices and features on the API level. It makes day-to-day development easier by enabling you to test and debug your apps without needing to don and doff your headset every time, and helps scale automation by simplifying your testing environment setup.
