# Meta XR Haptics SDK for Unity
Meta XR Haptics SDK for Unity provides a high-level, media-based API for playing haptic clips authored in Haptics Studio on Quest controllers. Playing back a haptic clip causes the controller to vibrate according to the vibration pattern stored in the clip.

The Haptics SDK provides a unified haptics API, regardless of the type of Quest controllers that are connected. The SDK detects the controller at runtime and optimizes the haptic pattern, maximizing the controllerâ€™s capabilities. This feature ensures your haptic clips are both backward and forward compatible with Quest devices.
