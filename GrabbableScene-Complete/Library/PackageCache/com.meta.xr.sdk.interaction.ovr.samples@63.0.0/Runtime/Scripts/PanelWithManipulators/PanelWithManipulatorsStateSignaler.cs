    /// It is not expected that typical users of the SlateWithManipulators prefab
    /// should need to either interact with or understand this script.
    ///
    /// This script centralizes state for the SlateWithManipulators prefab, allowing the
    /// various elements of the prefab to participate in statefulness without taking any
    /// direct dependencies on one another. Canonically, all interactable elements within
    /// the prefab will take references to this signaler, which they will use both to
    /// subscribe to the WhenStateChanged event and to set the state when appropriate.
    /// In this way, when one interactable element is selected, it can set the state and
    /// thereby notify other interested elements that the prefab as a whole, in a sense,
    /// has been selected; the other elements can then respond to this signal as
    /// appropriate, typically by becoming disabled for the duration of the selection.
    /// This signaler can also be used by external logic to set state for the entire
    /// prefab, for example to set the prefab to Idle when no interactors are nearby,
    /// though this is not part of the prefab's default behavior.
