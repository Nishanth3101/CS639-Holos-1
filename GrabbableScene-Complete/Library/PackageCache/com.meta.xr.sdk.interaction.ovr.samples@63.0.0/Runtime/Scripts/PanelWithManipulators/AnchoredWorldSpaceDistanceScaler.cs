    /// It is not expected that typical users of the SlateWithManipulators prefab
    /// should need to either interact with or understand this script.
    ///
    /// This script maintains scale based on the world-space relationship between a
    /// "local anchor" hierarchically parented to the transform on which this
    /// script resides and a "parent anchor" which is a hierarchical sibling. This
    /// logic is quite particular to that exact hierarchical configuration and is thus
    /// intended specifically for use within the SlateWithManipulators prefab.
    ///
    /// The specific world-space relationship maintained depends on the scaling mode.
    /// The default is a two-dimensional scaling mode which attempts to maintain a
    /// constant world-space offset between the local and parent anchors. Explicitly,
    /// with the local anchor placed at the top left corner of the "slate" and the
    /// parent anchor set to the AnchorTopLeft of the SlateWithManipulators prefab,
    /// this script will rescale the local space such that the world-space relationship
    /// between the AnchorTopLeft (and the visual affordances attached to it) and the
    /// local anchor (which logically represents the top-left corner of the "slate"
    /// content) is kept constant. As this is a two-dimensional scaling mode, the Z
    /// scale or "depth" of the slate is scaled to maintain a constant world-space
    /// depth.
    ///
    /// The spactial logic for the three-dimensional scaling mode is based on that
    /// of the two-dimensional scaling mode, but altered to maintain the original scale
    /// ratio of the content. This, as the name implies, is intended for manipulating
    /// object scale in three dimensions without squashing and stretching the object
    /// along the scaling axes. To this end, the script rescales the local space to
    /// find the largest aspect-correct scaling which can fit within the 2D rectangle
    /// described by the logic of the two-dimensional scaling mode. In other words,
    /// the three-dimensional scaling mode looks at where the slate content would have
    /// been placed by the two-dimensional scaling mode, then scales its 3D content to
    /// be as large as possible (without squashing) while still fitting within that
    /// "slate" space.
