# Dictation for Voice SDK

Voice SDK’s dictation feature enables your app to efficiently transcribe speech to text in real time. It functions similarly to voice commands except that it does not process the resultant text with natural-language understanding (NLU).

The dictation feature is not designed to be used for voice commands, but instead as a text input modality. While you could use regular expressions to parse it to use for handling commands, the text is formatted in a human readable format. As a result, you’ll get much better recognition results using immersive voice commands with Voice SDK’s AppVoiceExperience component.

For instructions on getting started, please see the Voice Hub documentation, under the menu Oculus -> Voice SDK -> Voice Hub.
