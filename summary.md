# A README to write the summary of the progress.

## Saksham Jain

- Before 18th March: Have been working on the Unity project creating the scene. Took models created by Jordan and Nishanth for the scene. Worked with Weibing to test it before the demo.
- After 18th March to April 8: Have been working on getting the Grab objets working. Initially used XR Integration Toolkit to implement but that did not work. Worked through and tried a lot of different methods before pivoting to Oculus Integration SDK and finally using Meta Integration SDK. Implemented Controller and Hand Grab on new Skeleton Model.
- From April 8: Going to work on packaging Hand Grabbable and AI.

## Weibing Wang
- Before 18th March: Focused primarily on completing and supplementing our project's website and its deployment. Worked alongside Saksham Jain on modifying and deploying our Unity project to the Meta Quest 3, contributing significantly to both the development and operational phases.
- After 18th March: Collaborated closely with Saksham Jain to finalize the deployment of our application to the Meta Quest 3. A key achievement during this period was the implementation of a draggable model feature, which enhanced user interaction within our virtual environment. Conducted comprehensive testing with Saksham Jain to ensure the seamless functionality and user experience of our application on the Meta Quest 3.
- From April 8 Onwards: Focused on the expansion of 3D models within our project, adding more depth and variety to our virtual environment.
Initiated the integration of external GPT capabilities into our project, aiming to enhance the interactive experience through advanced AI-driven interactions.
